          Hendrik Johannes Cruijff, also known as Johan Cruyff worldwide and born on April 25, 1947 in the Netherlands,
          was a professional footballer and manager. He won the Ballon d'Or three times as a player, in 1971, 1973, and
          1974. [4] Cruyff supported the Total Football football theory developed by Rinus Michels. He is well-known for
          being both one of the top managers in the sport's history and one of its greatest players. He is also regarded
          as one of the most important personalities in contemporary football.

          He finished third in a France Football poll that asked former Ballon d'Or winners to choose the Football

        <p class="word">Cruyff took a temporary hiatus in 1978. Cruyff insisted that his choice to resume his playing
          career in the United States was crucial in his career. He had lost most of his money in a series of bad
          investments, including a pig farm, that were advised by a con artist. As he recalled, "I had lost millions in
          pig-farming and that was the reason I decided to become a footballer again." With the special talent I
          possessed, he said, "It was wrong, a mistake, to give up playing at 31," and that "starting from zero in
          America, far from my past, was one of the best decisions I made. There, I learned how to channel my unbridled
          ambitions, find my voice, and become the person I wanted to be." </p>
