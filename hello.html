          He was a majestic playmaker who was at the heart of Rinus Michels' "Total Football" philosophy, which
          revolutionized the game. He won the Ballon d'Or three times. It allowed for a more fluid style of play, did
          away with rigid defensive systems, and allowed any player on the field to attack before being replaced by
          another. It was all about spacing and timing, and Cruyff's understanding of that concept was critical to its
          success. Cruyff carried Michels' ideology into his own coaching career with Ajax, and it continued to shape
          the Dutch national team, but more famously, his ideas and innovation flourished at Barcelona, and continue to
          do so to this day, as the Spanish powerhouse owes so much to Cruyff.

          He brought the philosophy he learned at Ajax to Barcelona, hoping to build a team that fans would enjoy
          watching. He accomplished this, and "El Dream Team" was born at Barcelona. Cruyff led them to four consecutive
          La Liga titles from 1990 to 1994, as well as their first-ever UEFA Champions League title in 1992, for a total
          of 11 trophies. Cruyff not only excelled as Barcelona's manager, but he also created a system that produced
          some of the world's greatest players. Cruyff founded Barcelona's famed La Masia academy because he wanted the
          ideals he learned at Ajax to become commonplace in Catalonia's capital city.

        <h2></h2>
        <p class="word">

          Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, and Xavi would not have become legendary figures if Cruyff and his ideology had
          not existed. The ideas he passed on to Barcelona helped them become one of the greatest clubs in history. With
          Jose Mourinho's defensive approach bearing fruit and other teams becoming more physical, it wasn't always easy
          for Barcelona to stick to Cruyff's philosophy, but they stuck to the principles of "Total Football" and
          developed "Tiki-taka," which has been revered the world over.

          He was an inspiration not only to those players, but also to the countless managers who now dominate the game.
          Pep Guardiola — the man who, with 15 trophies, surpassed Cruyff as the most successful Barcelona coach. Is
          perhaps the most prominent and best example of someone who idolized Cruyff and tried to emulate his ideas on a
          daily basis at both Barcelona and Bayern Munich.

          But it's not just Guardiola. Ronaldo de Boer, Ronald Koeman, Frank Rijkaard, Arsene Wenger, and countless
          others have taken Cruyff's ideas and had managerial success with them. His philosophy will be remembered for
          many generations, and Cruyff's legacy will live on. He was an outspoken individual when necessary, but he was
          also regarded as a good, kind man who was always willing to discuss his ideas and constantly came up with new
          ways of playing and implementing his philosophy.
